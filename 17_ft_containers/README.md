## 🗣️ About

> Reimplementation of stack, vector and map container types of the C++ standard template library (STL).

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/42_cursus/blob/main/_PDFs/en.subject_ft_containers.pdf)


 ## 🛠️ Usage
 
 Open a terminal and clone the repository in your local machine with the following command:
 
 `git clone https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/ft_containers.git`
 
 Once inside, navigate to the directory called tests and execute the command `make`
 
 This will compile all unit tests provided for this project, one for each of the functions reimplemented.
 
 Once we have the outputs, execute `make run`
 
 It will start comparing std library functions output with ours, along with leaks testing.
 
 Once testing is finished, all output objects would be removed.
